# Prompt Stash Node for ComfyUI

## Overview 📚

**Prompt Stash** is a simple plugin for ComfyUI that lets you save your prompts and organize them into multiple lists. It also features pass-through functionality, so you can hook it up to an LLM node (or any text outputting node) and capture its outputs directly—no more tedious copy-pasting! 🙌

I created this because I couldn't find any nodes that would let me cache a prompt or create and save prompts. I wanted an easy way to cache results from the LLM and store them for later use. So, I made this plugin, and I hope others find it useful too. 😊

5.  **Import**:

   - It will merge with any existing lists.
   - Prompts with the same name will have `(#)` added to them so they don't overwrite.

6. **Clear Paused State**:
   - If any workflows were closed while paused or the pause button vanishes, click **Clear All Paused** to reset all pause states.
